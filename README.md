Step : Hosting the Website
To host this website on a cloud platform, you can use GitHub Pages (for static websites like this one) or Netlify (for static sites with more features). Here’s how you can host it using GitHub Pages:

1. Set up GitHub Pages:
  Create a repository on GitHub.
  Upload your website files (index.html, resume.html, bio-data.html, styles.css, and script.js) to the repository.
  Go to the "Settings" of your repository, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
  Under "Source," choose the branch (usually main), and GitHub will automatically provide a link to your website.

2. Set up Netlify:
    Sign up for a free Netlify account at Netlify.
    Create a new site by selecting "GitHub" as your source and linking the repository containing your website.
    Netlify will automatically deploy your website, and you’ll receive a URL to access it.



Step : Test the Website
Once the website is hosted, visit the URL (provided by GitHub Pages or Netlify) and verify that the "Resume" and "Bio-data" pages are working correctly. The navigation links should take you to the respective pages, and the website should be properly styled.
